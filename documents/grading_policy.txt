## Grade Calculation

2. Common grading components include:
   - Homework assignments
   - Quizzes
   - Tests and exams
   - Projects
   - Class participation
   - Final exams

3. Final grades are calculated based on the weighted average of all grading components.

## Grade Reporting
1. Progress reports are issued at the midpoint of each grading period.
2. Report cards are issued at the end of each grading period.
3. Final grades are recorded on the student's transcript.
4. Parents and students can access grades through the online portal at any time.

## Academic Honors
1. Honor Roll: GPA of 3.5 or higher
2. High Honor Roll: GPA of 3.8 or higher
3. Principal's List: GPA of 4.0

## Grade Appeals
1. Students who wish to appeal a grade must first discuss the matter with the teacher.
2. If the matter is not resolved, the student may submit a written appeal to the department chair.
3. If still unresolved, the student may appeal to the principal.
4. All grade appeals must be initiated within two weeks of the grade being issued.

## Incomplete Grades
1. An "Incomplete" (I) may be assigned when a student has not completed all required work due to extenuating circumstances.
2. Students have two weeks after the end of the grading period to complete the work.
3. If the work is not completed within this timeframe, the "Incomplete" will be converted to an "F".

## Academic Integrity
1. All work submitted must be the student's own work.
2. Plagiarism, cheating, and other forms of academic dishonesty will result in a grade of zero for the assignment.
3. Repeated violations may result in course failure and disciplinary action.

## Students with Special Needs
1. Grading accommodations will be made in accordance with Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) and 504 plans.
2. Teachers will work with the special education department to implement appropriate accommodations.

## Credit Recovery
1. Students who fail a required course may recover credit through:
   - Summer school
   - Online credit recovery programs
   - Repeating the course
2. Credit recovery grades are noted on the transcript and limited to a maximum grade of "C".
